I'm a behavioural ecologist, and occasional comparative psychologist, aiming to understand how different individuals manage their social lives and the impact these choices have on social structures. My work focuses on wild, non-human primates as model species to address these questions. Most primate species are under threat due to anthropogenic activity. Therefore, I hope to ascertain how group-living may mediate or exaggerate human-related threats to individual fitness, as well as population persistence and survival.

Prior to a career in academia, I worked as an ecological consultant on coastal conservation projects, and before that as a medical writer.

Outside of work, I'm a long-suffering Pompey fan, comic book enthusiast, and hobbyist photographer and illustrator.
