abstract: "Several theories have been generated to understand the socio-cognitive\
  \ mechanisms underlying the unique cooperative abilities of humans. The ‘interdependence\
  \ hypothesis' posits first, that the cognitive dimension of human cooperation evolved\
  \ in contexts when several individuals needed to act together to achieve a common\
  \ goal, like when hunting large prey. Second, the more interdependent individuals\
  \ are, the more likely they are to provide services to conspecifics in other contexts.\
  \ Alternatively, the ‘social tolerance hypothesis' proposes that higher social tolerance\
  \ allows conspecifics to cooperate more efficiently and with a wider range of partners.\
  \ We conducted the first field experimental evaluation of both hypotheses in our\
  \ closest living relatives by contrasting chimpanzees to the less interdependent\
  \ but more tolerant bonobos. We compared each species' performance during a cooperative\
  \ task: informing conspecifics about a danger. We presented Gaboon viper models\
  \ to 82 individuals from five wild communities. Chimpanzees arriving late at the\
  \ snake were significantly more likely to have heard a call and less likely to startle,\
  \ indicating that chimpanzees were better informed about the presence of the threat\
  \ than bonobos. This stems from clear species differences in how individuals adjusted\
  \ their calling decisions to the level of information already available. Chimpanzees\
  \ were more likely to call and produced more alarm calls when they had not yet heard\
  \ a call, whereas bonobos did so when they already heard a call. Our results confirm\
  \ the link between interdependence and cooperation performance. These species differences\
  \ were most likely driven by differences in motivation rather than in cognitive\
  \ capacities because both species tended to consider audience knowledge in their\
  \ decision to call. Our results inform theories on the evolution of human cooperation\
  \ by linking inter-group competition pressure and in-group cooperative motivation\
  \ and/or capability."
