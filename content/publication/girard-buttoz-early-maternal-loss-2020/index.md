abstract: $<$p$>$In mammals, early life adversity negatively affects survival and
  reproductive success. A key causal mechanism is proposed by the biological embedding
  model which posits that adversity experienced early in life has deleterious consequences
  on individual physiology across the lifespan. In particular, early life adversity
  is expected to be a severe stressor leading to long-term alteration of the hypothalamic
  pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Here we tested this idea by assessing whether,
  as in humans, maternal loss had short and long-term impacts on orphan chimpanzee
  urinary cortisol levels and diurnal urinary cortisol slopes, as an indicator of
  the HPA axis functioning. We used 18 years of data on 50 immature and 28 mature
  male wild chimpanzees belonging to four communities in Tai National Park, Ivory
  Coast. Immature orphans who experienced early maternal loss had diurnal cortisol
  slopes characterised by higher early morning and late afternoon cortisol levels
  indicative of high activation of the HPA axis. Recently orphaned immatures had higher
  cortisol levels than other immatures, possibly reflecting social and nutritional
  stress. However, unlike in humans, we did not find significantly different cortisol
  profiles in orphan and non-orphan adult male chimpanzees. Our study highlights that
  long-term alteration of stress physiology related to early life adversity may not
  be viable in some wild animal populations and/or that chimpanzees, as humans, may
  have access to mechanisms that buffer this physiological stress, such as adoption.
  Our results suggest that biological embedding of altered HPA axis function is unlikely
  to be a mechanism contributing to the demonstrated long-term fitness consequences
  of maternal loss, such as reduced reproductive success, in wild long-lived mammals.$<$/p$>$
