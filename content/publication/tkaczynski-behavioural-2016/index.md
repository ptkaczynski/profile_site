abstract: Personality, that is intra-individual consistency and inter-individual variation
  in behaviour, is widespread throughout the animal kingdom. This challenges traditional
  evolutionary assumptions that selection should favour behavioural flexibility, and
  that variation in behavioural strategies reflects stochastic variation around a
  single optimal behavioural strategy. Adaptive models to explain personality within
  the framework of evolutionary and behavioural ecology exist, and are typically empirically
  explored by identifying proximate associations to, and the functional consequences
  of, personality expression. To date, such studies have typically quantified a narrow
  range of personality traits within a species, and focused on captive populations
  or species with relatively limited behavioural or social repertoires. In this thesis,
  personality is studied in wild Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus). Quantification
  of personality structure in the species was conducted using a multi-method approach,
  and subsequently, it was examined whether physiological stress response (a proximate
  association) was related to personality expression, and whether personality expression
  affected social (functional) outcomes for individuals. Seven personality constructs
  were identified in Barbary macaques. Three personality constructs were related to
  physiological stress responses (Excitability, Tactility and Exploration), with the
  relationship between stress and personality expression dependent on sex, and in
  some cases rank or age. Two personality constructs (Excitability and Exploration)
  were associated with measures of social integration. Subjects generally socially
  assorted themselves according to personality, tending to be in proximity to individuals
  with a similar personality to themselves. This study contributes methodologically
  by demonstrating the plausibility of multi-method approaches to measuring personality
  in wild primates, and empirically, by generating evidence supporting adaptive models
  for the evolution of personality, namely that intra-individual consistency in behaviour
  may be mediated by physiology and that inter-individual variation in behaviour has
  functional benefits in the formation of social relationships and social structures.
