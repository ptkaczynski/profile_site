abstract: Postnatal development is protracted relative to lifespan in many primates,
  including modern humans (Homo sapiens), facilitating the acquisition of key motor,
  communication and social skills that can maximize fitness later in life. Nevertheless,
  it remains unclear what evolutionary drivers led to extended immature periods. While
  the developmental milestone literature is well established in humans, insight we
  can gain from one-species models is limited. By comparing the timing of relatable
  developmental milestones in a closely related species, the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes),
  we can gain further understanding of the evolution of such an extended developmental
  phase. To date, few studies have specifically attempted to estimate developmental
  milestones in a manner comparable to the human literature, and existing studies
  lack sufficient sample sizes to estimate which milestones are more plastic with
  higher inter-individual variation in the timing of their emergence. Here, we describe
  the emergence of gross motor, fine motor, social interaction and communication traits
  from a longitudinal sample of 19 wild chimpanzee infants (8 females and 11 males),
  Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire. Gross motor traits emerged at a mean of 4 months,
  communication traits at 12 months, social interaction traits at 14 months and fine
  motor traits at 15 months, with later emerging milestones demonstrating greater
  inter-individual variation in the timing of the emergence. This pattern of milestone
  emergence is broadly comparable to observations in humans, suggesting selection
  for a prolonged infantile phase and that sustained skills development has a deep
  evolutionary history, with implications for theories on primate brain development.
