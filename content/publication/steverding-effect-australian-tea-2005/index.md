abstract: Gyrodactylus spp. infections of commercially farmed fishes are responsible
  for significant economic losses. Existing treatments have proved uneconomic, stressful
  to the fishes, and ecologically damaging. Essential oils are naturally occurring
  compounds that exhibit a wide range of anti-microbial and anti-fungal activities.
  This study explored the possibility of using Australian tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia)
  oil (TTO) to treat Gyrodactylus spp. infection on the three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus
  aculeatus. In the presence of 0.01% Tween 80 as an emulsifier, TTO treatments at
  concentrations between 3 and 30 ppmv (parts per million by volume) lowered the prevalence
  and significantly reduced the parasite burden of sticklebacks naturally infected
  with Gyrodactylus spp. In addition, Tween 80 alone exhibited parasiticidal activity
  against Gyrodactylus spp. These findings show the potential of TTO in combination
  with Tween 80 as an effective treatment of Gyrodactylus spp. infection of fishes.
