abstract: Behavioural syndromes are a well-established phenomenon in human and non-human
  animal behavioural ecology. However, the mechanisms that lead to correlations among
  behaviours and individual consistency in their expression at the apparent expense
  of behavioural plasticity remain unclear. The ‘state-dependent' hypothesis posits
  that inter-individual variation in behaviour arises from inter-individual variation
  in state and that the relative stability of these states within an individual leads
  to consistency of behaviour. The endocrine stress response, in part mediated by
  glucocorticoids (GCs), is a proposed behavioural syndrome-associated state as GC
  levels are linked to an individual's behavioural responses to stressors. In this
  study, in wild Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus), consistent inter-individual differences
  were observed in both sexes for GC activity (faecal glucocorticoid, fGC concentrations),
  but not GC variation (coefficient of variation in fGC concentrations). The expression
  of the behavioural syndrome ‘Excitability' (characterized by the frequencies of
  brief affiliation or aggressive interactions) was related to GC activity in males
  but not in females; more ‘excitable' males had lower GC activity. There was no relationship
  in females between any of the behavioural syndromes and GC activity, nor in either
  sex with GC variation. The negative relationship between GC activity and Excitability
  in males provides some support for GC expression as a behavioural syndrome-generating
  state under the state-dependent framework. The absence of this relationship in females
  highlights that state-behavioural syndrome associations may not be generalizable
  within a species and that broader sex differences in state need to be considered
  for understanding the emergence and maintenance of behavioural syndromes.
