abstract: Consistent individual differences in social phenotypes have been observed
  in many animal species. Changes in demographics, dominance hierarchies or ecological
  factors, such as food availability or disease prevalence, are expected to influence
  decision-making processes regarding social interactions. Therefore, it should be
  expected that individuals show flexibility rather than stability in social behaviour
  over time to maximize the fitness benefits of social living. Understanding the processes
  that create and maintain social phenotypes requires data encompassing a range of
  socioecological settings and variation in intrinsic state or life-history stage
  or strategy. Using observational data spanning up to 19 years for some individuals,
  we demonstrate that multiple types of social behaviour are repeatable over the long
  term in wild chimpanzees, a long-lived species with complex fissionâ€“fusion societies.
  We controlled for temporal, ecological and demographic changes, limiting pseudo-repeatability.
  We conclude that chimpanzees living in natural ecological settings have relatively
  stable long-term social phenotypes over years that may be independent of life-history
  or reproductive strategies. Our results add to the growing body of the literature
  suggesting consistent individual differences in social tendencies are more likely
  the rule rather than the exception in group-living animals.
