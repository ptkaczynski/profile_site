abstract: In animals with altricial offspring, most growth occurs after birth and
  may be optimized by post-natal maternal care. Maternal effects on growth may be
  influenced by individual characteristics of the mothers, such as social status,
  individual investment strategies and the length of association with offspring. The
  prolonged juvenile dependence seen in humans is a distinctive life history adaptation,
  which may have evolved to facilitate sustained somatic and brain growth.
