abstract: Spatial position within a group affects the value of group-living benefits
  such as reduced predation risk and improved foraging. The threat of predation, poor
  nutrition or increased competition from conspecifics can all cause stress. In many
  species, central positions are known to be more beneficial than peripheral positions
  in terms of reduced predation, vigilance and foraging. In this study, we examine
  whether spatial position within a group is associated with stress and anxiety in
  a troop of olive baboons (Papio anubis). We predicted that the benefits of occupying
  central positions would be reflected by a reduction in stress and anxiety for animals
  who spent the most time in the centre of the group. The study subjects appeared
  to compete actively for the centre of the group. Physiological stress measures (faecal
  glucocorticoid concentrations) were positively correlated with time spent in central
  positions. Time spent in central positions was positively correlated with proximity
  but negatively correlated with vigilance behaviours (alarm barks). Vigilance rates
  were positively correlated with measures of anxiety (self-scratch frequency). It
  is suggested that individuals experience chronic stress due to proximity to conspecifics
  in central positions, whilst perceived predation risk causes anxiety, with perceived
  predation risk experienced more by individuals on the periphery.
