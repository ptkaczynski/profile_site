abstract: Compared with most mammals, postnatal development in great apes is protracted,
  presenting both an extended period of phenotypic plasticity to environmental conditions
  and the potential for sustained mother-offspring and/or sibling conflict over resources.
  Comparisons of cortisol levels during ontogeny can reveal physiological plasticity
  to species or population specific socioecological factors and in turn how these
  factors might ameliorate or exaggerate mother-offspring and sibling conflict. Here,
  we examine developmental patterns of cortisol levels in two wild chimpanzee populations
  (Budongo and Taï), with two and three communities each, and one wild bonobo population
  (LuiKotale), with two communities. Both species have similar juvenile life histories.
  Nonetheless, we predicted that key differences in socioecological factors, such
  as feeding competition, would lead to interspecific variation in mother-offspring
  and sibling conflict and thus variation in ontogenetic cortisol patterns. We measured
  urinary cortisol levels in 1394 samples collected from 37 bonobos and 100 chimpanzees
  aged up to 12 years. The significant differences in age-related variation in cortisol
  levels appeared population specific rather than species specific. Both bonobos and
  Taï chimpanzees had comparatively stable and gradually increasing cortisol levels
  throughout development; Budongo chimpanzees experienced declining cortisol levels
  before increases in later ontogeny. These age-related population differences in
  cortisol patterns were not explained by mother-offspring or sibling conflict specifically;
  instead, the comparatively stable cortisol patterns of bonobos and Taï chimpanzees
  likely reflect a consistency in experience of competition and the social environment
  compared with Budongo chimpanzees, where mothers may adopt more variable strategies
  related to infanticide risk and resource availability. The clear population-level
  differences within chimpanzees highlight potential intraspecific flexibility in
  developmental processes in apes, suggesting the flexibility and diversity in rearing
  strategies seen in humans may have a deep evolutionary history.
