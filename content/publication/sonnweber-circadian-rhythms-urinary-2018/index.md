abstract: Investigating the repeatability of trait variation between individuals,
  that is the amount of individual variation in relation to overall phenotypic variation,
  indicates an upper level of heritability and reveals whether a given trait may be
  subject to selection. Labile traits are characterized by high levels of flexibility
  and consequently low trait repeatability is expected. Indeed, research examining
  glucocorticoid levels in various non-mammal species found low repeatability scores.
  However, mammals may be different in this respect as (i) differential maternal care
  early in life has the potential to prime hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning
  and (ii) allelic variation affecting hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning
  has been reported. Individuals often differ from each other in average and/or plastic
  labile trait expression, two aspects that can be described using a reaction norm
  approach. Both consistent and flexible reaction norm expression has been argued
  to serve adaptive purposes, depending on the stability and predictability of environmental
  conditions. Here we investigated both trait and reaction norm repeatability of urinary
  cortisol levels in wild adult male chimpanzees. To capture the expression of the
  circadian urinary cortisol rhythm of individual males over time, urine samples were
  collected throughout the day. In total data of 30 males collected over a period
  of 8 years were included in the dataset. No male was sampled over the whole 8-year
  period however. We found minor levels of trait repeatability but considerable reaction
  norm repeatability. This implies a minor role of genetic or priming factors on cortisol
  excretion, but reveals that males differ consistently in average urinary cortisol
  levels and the shape of the circadian urinary cortisol rhythm. Relating these results
  to fitness parameters will provide answers to questions on the adaptive value of
  reaction norm repeatability of this labile hormonal trait in the future.
