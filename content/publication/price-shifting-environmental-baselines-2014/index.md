abstract: The Red Sea is among the world’s top marine biodiversity hotspots. We re-examined
  coastal ecosystems at sites surveyed during the 1980s using the same methodology.
  Coral cover increased significantly towards the north, mirroring the reverse pattern
  for mangroves and other sedimentary ecosystems. Latitudinal patterns are broadly
  consistent across both surveys and with results from independent studies. Coral
  cover showed greatest change, declining significantly from a median score of 4 (1000–9999m2)
  to 2 (10–99m2) per quadrat in 2010/11. This may partly reflect impact from coastal
  construction, which was evident at 40% of sites and has significantly increased
  in magnitude over 30years. Beach oil has significantly declined, but shore debris
  has increased significantly. Although substantial, levels are lower than at some
  remote ocean atolls. While earlier reports have suggested that the Red Sea is generally
  healthy, shifting environmental baselines are evident from the current study.
