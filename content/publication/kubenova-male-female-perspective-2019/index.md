abstract: Infant care from adult males is unexpected in species with high paternity
  uncertainty. Still, males of several polygynandrous primates engage in frequent
  affiliative interactions with infants. Two non-exclusive hypotheses link male infant
  care to male mating strategies. The paternal investment hypothesis views infant
  care as a male strategy to maximize the survival of sired offspring, while the mating
  effort hypothesis predicts that females reward males who cared for their infant
  by preferably mating with them. Both hypotheses predict a positive relationship
  between infant care and matings with a particular female. However, the paternal
  investment hypothesis predicts that increased matings come before infant care whereas
  the mating effort hypothesis predicts that infant care precedes an increase in matings.
  Both hypotheses are usually tested from the perspective of the proportion of matings
  and care that individual females engage in and receive, rather than from the perspective
  of the care and mating behaviour of individual males. We tested the relationships
  between care and mating from both female and male perspectives in Barbary macaques.
  Mating predicted subsequent care and care predicted subsequent mating when viewed
  from the male but not the female perspective. Males mainly cared for infants of
  their main mating partners, but infants were not mainly cared for by their likely
  father. Males mated more with the mothers of their favourite infants, but females
  did not mate more with the main caretakers of their infants. We suggest that females
  do not choose their mating partners based on previous infant care, increasing paternity
  confusion. Males might try to increase paternal investment by distributing the care
  according to their own instead of female mating history. Further, males pursue females
  for mating opportunities based on previous care.
