abstract: Individuals with more or stronger social bonds experience enhanced survival
  and reproduction in various species, though the mechanisms mediating these effects
  are unclear. Social thermoregulation is a common behaviour across many species which
  reduces cold stress exposure, body heat loss, and homeostatic energy costs, allowing
  greater energetic investment in growth, reproduction, and survival, with larger
  aggregations providing greater benefits. If more social individuals form larger
  thermoregulation aggregations due to having more potential partners, this would
  provide a direct link between sociality and fitness. We conducted the first test
  of this hypothesis by studying social relationships and winter sleeping huddles
  in wild Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus), wherein individuals with more social
  partners experience greater probability of winter survival. Precipitation and low
  temperature increased huddle sizes, supporting previous research that huddle size
  influences thermoregulation and energetics. Huddling relationships were predicted
  by social (grooming) relationships. Individuals with more social partners therefore
  formed larger huddles, suggesting reduced energy expenditure and exposure to environmental
  stressors than less social individuals, potentially explaining how sociality affects
  survival in this population. This is the first evidence that social thermoregulation
  may be a direct proximate mechanism by which increased sociality enhances fitness,
  which may be widely applicable across taxa.
