abstract: In order to maintain regulatory processes, animals are expected to be adapted
  to the range of environmental stressors usually encountered in their environmental
  niche. The available capacity of their stress responses is termed their reactive
  scope, which is utilised to a greater or lesser extent to deal with different stressors.
  Typically, non-invasive hormone assessment is used to measure the physiological
  stress responses of wild animals, but, for methodological reasons, such measurements
  are not directly comparable across studies, limiting interpretation. To overcome
  this constraint, we propose a new measure of the relative strength of stress responses,
  'demonstrated reactive scope', and illustrate its use in a study of ecological correlates
  (climate, food availability) of faecal glucocorticoid (fGC) levels in two forest-living
  troops of baboons. Results suggest the wild-feeding troop experiences both thermoregulatory
  and nutritional stress, while the crop-raiding troop experiences only thermoregulatory
  stress. This difference, together with the crop-raiding troop's lower overall physiological
  stress levels and lower demonstrated fGC reactive scope, may reflect nutritional
  stress-buffering in this troop. The relatively high demonstrated fGC reactive scope
  levels of both troops compared with other baboons and primate species, may reflect
  their extreme habitat, on the edge of the geographic range for baboons. Demonstrated
  reactive scope provides a means of gauging the relative strengths of stress responses
  of individuals, populations, or species under different conditions, enhancing the
  interpretive capacity of non-invasive studies of stress hormone levels in wild populations,
  e.g. in terms of animals' adaptive flexibility, the magnitude of their response
  to anthropogenic change, or the severity of impact of environmental conditions.
