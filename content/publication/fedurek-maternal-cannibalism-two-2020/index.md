abstract: Maternal cannibalism has been reported in several animal taxa, prompting
  speculations that the behavior may be part of an evolved strategy. In chimpanzees,
  however, maternal cannibalism has been conspicuously absent, despite high levels
  of infant mortality and reports of non-maternal cannibalism. The typical response
  of chimpanzee mothers is to abandon their deceased infant, sometimes after prolonged
  periods of carrying and grooming the corpse. Here, we report two anomalous observations
  of maternal cannibalism in communities of wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Ivory Coast
  and discuss the evolutionary implications. Both infants likely died under different
  circumstances; one apparently as a result of premature birth, the other possibly
  as a result of infanticide. In both cases, the mothers consumed parts of the corpse
  and participated in meat sharing with other group members. Neither female presented
  any apparent signs of ill health before or after the events. We concluded that,
  in both cases, cannibalizing the infant was unlikely due to health-related issues
  by the mothers. We discuss these observations against a background of chimpanzee
  mothers consistently refraining from maternal cannibalism, despite ample opportunities
  and nutritional advantages. We conclude that maternal cannibalism is extremely rare
  in this primate, likely due to early and strong mother-offspring bond formation,
  which may have been profoundly disrupted in the current cases.
