abstract: Strategic microhabitat selection allows animals in seasonally cold environments
  to reduce homeostatic energy costs, particularly overnight when thermoregulatory
  demands are greatest. Suitable sleeping areas may therefore represent important
  resources for winter survival. Knowledge of microhabitat use and potential impacts
  of anthropogenic habitat modification can aid species conservation through development
  of targeted habitat management plans. Wild, endangered Barbary macaques (Macaca
  sylvanus) in logged cedar-oak forest were studied to investigate (1) the hypothesis
  that macaques select winter sleeping areas with microhabitat characteristics that
  may reduce thermoregulatory costs, and, if so, (2) how to minimize damage to sleeping
  areas from logging. Macaques slept only in Atlas cedars (Cedrus atlantica). Consistent
  with predictions, macaques preferred sleeping in sheltered topography and dense
  vegetation, which may reduce exposure to wind, precipitation and cold, and preferred
  large trees that facilitate social huddling. This suggests that Barbary macaques
  employ strategic nocturnal microhabitat selection to reduce thermoregulatory costs
  and thus suitable sleeping areas may influence winter survival. To minimize negative
  impacts of logging on macaque sleeping areas, results suggest avoiding logging in
  topographical depressions and maintaining cedar densities greater than 250 haâˆ’1
  with average breast height greater than 60 cm. This study demonstrates how animal
  behaviour can be used to guide species-specific habitat management plans.
