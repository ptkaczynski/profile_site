abstract: Signalling plays an important role in mediating social interactions in many
  animal species. For example, during approaches certain species produce ‘greetings’,
  which can take the form of vocal or visual signals, which reduce the probability
  of aggressive interactions and/or facilitate affiliation when approaching each other.
  However, in species where greetings comprise both vocal and visual signals, little
  is known about how the vocal component relates to the visual component or, in species
  with fission–fusion dynamics, to the time spent together by the dyad in the same
  subgroup prior to the approach. Similarly, in species with several acoustic variants
  of greeting calls, it is unclear whether different variants have different functions.
  We looked at the production of two acoustically distinct greeting call variants,
  low-fundamental frequency pant grunts and high-fundamental frequency pant barks,
  during approaches between two individuals in five communities of wild chimpanzees,
  Pan troglodytes, in Uganda and Ivory Coast. More specifically, we explored the relationship
  between greeting call production and (1) aggressive and submissive interactions
  during the approach and (2) preceding and subsequent proximity levels between the
  involved individuals. Calls were more likely to be produced during aggressive interactions
  and were associated with postures and gestures linked to submission; these patterns
  were stronger when the utterance contained a pant bark rather than a pant grunt
  alone. The production of greeting calls was more likely soon after party fusion
  and was negatively related to subsequent proximity levels between the caller and
  receiver. These results expand our knowledge of greeting calls and imply that these
  calls might be used to re-establish dominance relationships after a period of separation,
  and that the function of these calls can be modulated by their specific acoustic
  variants and by visual signals that often accompany them.
